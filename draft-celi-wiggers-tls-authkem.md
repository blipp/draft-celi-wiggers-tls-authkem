# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft.

This document gives a construction for KEM-based authentication in TLS
1.3.  The overall design approach is a simple: usage of Key Encapsulation
Mechanisms (KEMs) for certificate-based authentication. Authentication happens via
asymmetric cryptography by the usage of KEMs advertised as the long-term KEM public
keys in the Certificate.

TLS 1.3 is in essence a signed key exchange protocol (if using certificate-based
authentication). Authentication in TLS 1.3 is achieved by signing the handshake
transcript. KEM-based authentication provides authentication by deriving a
shared secret that is encapsulated against the public key contained in the
certificate. Only the holder of the private key corresponding to the certificate's
public key can derive the same shared secret and thus decrypt it's peers
messages.

This approach is appropriate for endpoints that have KEM public keys. Though
this is currently rare, certificates could be issued with (EC)DH public keys as
specified for instance in {{!RFC8410}}, or using a delegation
mechanism, such as delegated credentials {{!I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts}}.

In this proposal we use the DH-based KEMs from {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}. We
believe KEMs are especially worth discussing in the context of the TLS protocol
because NIST is in the process of standardizing post-quantum KEM algorithms to
replace "classic" key exchange (based on elliptic curve or finite-field
Diffie-Hellman [NISTPQC]).

This proposal draws inspiration from {{!I-D.ietf-tls-semistatic-dh}}, which is in
turn based on the OPTLS proposal for TLS 1.3 [KW16]. However, these proposals
require a non-interactive key exchange: they combine the client's public key with
the server's long-term key. This imposes a requirement that the ephemeral and
static keys use the same algorithm, which this proposal does not require.
Additionally, there are no post-quantum proposals for a non-interactive key
exchange currently considered for standardization, while several KEMs are on the
way.

## Organization

After a brief introduction to KEMs, we will introduce the AuthKEM authentication mechanism.
For clarity, we discuss unilateral and mutual authentication separately.
Next we will introduce the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake, and its opportunistic client authentication mechanism.
In the remainder of the draft we will discuss the necessary implementation mechanics, such as code points, extensions, new protocol messages and the new key schedule.

# Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Terminology

The following terms are used as they are in {{!RFC8446}}

client:  The endpoint initiating the TLS connection.

connection:  A transport-layer connection between two endpoints.

endpoint:  Either the client or server of the connection.

handshake:  An initial negotiation between client and server that
  establishes the parameters of their subsequent interactions
  within TLS.

peer:  An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer"
  refers to the endpoint that is not the primary subject of
  discussion.

receiver:  An endpoint that is receiving records.

sender:  An endpoint that is transmitting records.

server:  The endpoint that this did initiate the TLS connection.
  i.e. the peer of the client.

## Key Encapsulation Mechanisms

As this proposal relies heavily on KEMs, which are not originally
used by TLS, we will provide a brief overview of this primitive.

A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is a cryptographic primitive that defines
the methods ``Encapsulate`` and ``Decapapsulate``. In this draft, we extend these
operations with context separation strings:

``Encapsulate(pkR, context_string)``:    Takes a public key, and produces a shared secret and encapsulation.

``Decapsulate(enc, skR, context_str)``:  Takes the encapsulation and the private key. Returns the shared secret.

We implement these methods through the KEMs defined in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}
as follows to export shared secrets appropriate for the use of HKDF in TLS 1.3:

~~~
def Encapsulate(pk, context_string):
  enc, ctx = HPKE.SetupBaseS(pk, "tls13 auth-kem " + context_string)
  ss = ctx.Export("", HKDF.Length)
  return (enc, ss)
    
Decapsulate(enc, sk, context_string) =
  HPKE.SetupBaseR(enc, sk, "tls13 auth-kem " + context_string)
      .Export("", HKDF.Length)
~~~

Keys are generated and encoded for transmission following the conventions in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.

# Full 1.5-RTT AuthKEM Handshake Protocol


Figure 1 below shows the basic KEM-authentication (KEM-Auth) handshake,
without client authentication:

~~~~~
       Client                                     Server

Key  ^ ClientHello

                                             + key_share  v Exch

           previously noted message.

           derived from a [sender]_handshake_traffic_secret.
        {} Indicates messages protected using keys
           derived from a
           [sender]_authenticated_handshake_traffic_secret.
        [] Indicates messages protected using keys
           derived from [sender]_application_traffic_secret_N.

       Figure 1: Message Flow for KEM-Authentication (KEM-Auth)
                 Handshake without client authentication.
~~~~~

This basic handshake captures the core of AuthKEM.
Instead of using a signature to authenticate the handshake, the client encapsulates a shared secret to the server's certificate.
Only the server that holds the private key corresponding to the certificate can derive the same shared secret.
This shared secret is mixed into the handshake's key schedule.
The client does not have to wait for the server's ``Finished`` message before it can send data. 
It knows that its message can only be decrypted if the server was able to derive the authentication shared secret encapsulated in the ``KEMEncapsulation`` message. 

``Finished`` messages are sent as in TLS 1.3, and achieve full explicit authentication.

## Client authentication

For client authentication, the server sends the ``CertificateRequest`` message as in {{RFC8446}}.
This message can not be authenticated in during the AuthKEM handshake: we will discuss the implications below.

As in {{RFC8446}}, section 4.4.2, if and only if the client receives ``CertificateRequest``, it MUST send a ``Certificate`` message.
If the client has no suitable certificate, it MUST send a ``Certificate`` message containing no certificates.
If the server is satisfied with the provided certificate, it MUST send back a ``KEMEncapsulation`` message, containing the encapsulation to the client's certificate.
The resulting shared secret is mixed into the key schedule.
This ensures any messages sent using keys derived from it are covered by the authentication.

The AuthKEM handshake with client authentication is given in Figure 2.

       Figure 2: Message Flow for KEM-Authentication (KEM-Auth) 
                 Handshake with client authentication.
~~~~~

If the server is not satisfied with the client's certificates, it MAY, at its discretion, decide to continue or terminate the handshake.

Unfortunately, AuthKEM client authentication requires an extra round-trip.
Clients that know the server's long-term public KEM key might choose to use the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake and opportunistically send the client certificate as a 0-RTT-like message.
We will discuss this later.

## Relevant handshake messages

After the Key Exchange and Server Parameters phase of TLS 1.3 handshake, the
client and server exchange implicitly authenticated messages.
KEM-based authentication uses the same set of messages every time that
certificate-based authentication is needed.  Specifically:

* ``Certificate``:  The certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate   extensions.  This message is omitted by the client if the server did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that the client should not authenticate with a certificate). For AuthKEM, `Certificate` MUST include the long-term KEM public key.

  Certificates MUST be handled in accordance with {{RFC8446}}, section 4.4.2.4.

* ``KEMEncapsulation``: A key encapsulation against the certificate's long-term   public key, which yields an implicitly authenticated shared secret.

## Differences with RFC8446 TLS 1.3

* New types of ``signature_algorithms`` for KEMs.
* New handshake message ``KEMEncapsulation``
* The client sends ``Finished`` before the server.
* The clients sends data before the server has sent ``Finished``.

## Implicit and explicit authentication 

The data that the client MAY transmit to the server before having received the server's ``Finished`` is encrypted
using ciphersuites chosen based on the client's and server's advertised preferences in the `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages.
The ``ServerHello`` message can however not be authenticated before the ``Finished`` message from the server is verified.
The full implications of this are discussed in the Security Considerations section.

Upon receiving the client's authentication messages, the server responds with its
Finished message, which achieves explicit authentication.
Upon receiving the server's ``Finished`` message, the client achieves explicit
authentication.
Receiving this message retroactively confirms the server's cryptographic parameter choices.

## Authenticating CertificateRequest

The ``CertificateRequest`` message can not be authenticated during the AuthKEM handshake;
only after ``Finished`` from the server has been processed do we know it was authentic.
The security implications of this are discussed later.

**This is dicussed in [Github issue #16](https://github.com/claucece/draft-celi-wiggers-tls-authkem/issues/16).
We would welcome feedback there.**

Clients MAY choose to only accept post-handshake authentication.
[Todo: Should they indicate this?]


# Abbreviated AuthKEM with pre-shared public KEM keys

When the client already has the server's long-term public key, we can do a more efficient handshake.
The client will send the encapsulation to the server's long-term public key in a ``ClientHello`` extension.
An overview of the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake is given in Figure 3.

A client that already knows the server, might also already know that it will be required to present a client certificate.
We expect this to be especially useful in server-to-server scenarios.
The abbreviated handshake allows to encrypt the certificate and send it like early data.

## Negotiation {#sec-authkem-pdk-negotiation}

A client that knows a server's long-term KEM public key MAY choose to attempt the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake.
If it does so, it MUST include the ``stored_auth_key`` extension in the ``ClientHello`` message.
This message MUST contain the encapsulation against the long-term KEM public key.
Details of the extension are described below.
The shared secret resulting from the encapsulation is mixed in to the EarlySecret computation. 

The client MAY additionally choose to send a certificate to the server.
It MUST know what ciphersuites the server accepts before it does so.
If it chooses to do so, it MUST send the ``early_auth`` extension to the server.
The ``Certificate`` is encrypted with the ``client_early_handshake_traffic_secret``.

TODO: describe encaps/decaps parameters.

The server MAY accept the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake.
If it does, it MUST reply with a ``stored_auth_key`` extension.
If it does not accept the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake, for instance because it does not have access to the correct secret key anymore, it MUST NOT reply with a `stored_auth_key` extension.
The server, if it accepts the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake, MAY additionally accept the ``Certificate`` message.
If it does, it MUST reply with a ``early_auth`` extension.

If the client, who sent a ``stored_auth_key`` extension, receives a ``ServerHello`` without ``stored_auth_key`` extension,
it MUST recompute ``EarlySecret`` without the encapsulated shared secret. 
If the client sent a ``Certificate`` message, it MUST drop that message from its transcript.
The client MUST then continue with a full AuthKEM handshake.

## 0-RTT, forward secrecy and replay protection

The client MAY send 0-RTT data, as in {{RFC8446}} 0-RTT mode.
The ``Certificate`` MUST be sent before the 0-RTT data.

As the ``EarlySecret`` is derived only from a key encapsulated to a long-term secret, it does not have forward secrecy.
Clients MUST take this into consideration before transmitting 0-RTT data or opting in to early client auth.
Certificates and 0-RTT data may also be replayed.

This will be discussed in full under Security Considerations.

# Implementation

In this section we will discuss the implementation details such as extensions and key schedule.

## Negotiation of AuthKEM

Clients will indicate support for this mode by negotiating it as if
it were a signature scheme (part of the `signature_algorithms` extension). We thus
add these new signature scheme values (even though, they are not signature
schemes) for the KEMs defined in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}} Section 7.1. Note that
we will be only using their internal KEM's API defined there.

~~~
  enum {
    dhkem_p256_sha256   => TBD,
    dhkem_p384_sha384   => TBD,
    dhkem_p521_sha512   => TBD,
    dhkem_x25519_sha256 => TBD,
    dhkem_x448_sha512   => TBD,
  }
~~~

When present in the `signature_algorithms` extension, these values indicate AuthKEM support with the specified key exchange mode. 
These values MUST NOT appear in `signature_algorithms_cert`, as this extension specifies the signing algorithms by which certificates are signed.

## ClientHello and ServerHello extensions


A number of AuthKEM messages contain tag-length-value encoded extensions structures. 
We are adding those extensions to the `ExtensionType` list from TLS 1.3.

~~~
enum {
    ...
    stored_auth_key (TBD),                 /* RFC TBD */
    early_auth (TBD),                      /* RFC TBD */  
    (65535)
} ExtensionType;
~~~

The table below indicates the messages where a given extension may
appear:

~~~
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| Extension                             |    KEM-Auth |
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
| stored_auth_key [RFCTBD]              |      CH, SH |
|                                       |             |
| early_auth  [RFCTBD]                  |      CH, SH |
|                                       |             |
+---------------------------------------+-------------+
~~~

#### Stored Auth Key

To transmit the early authentication encapsulation in the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake, this document defines a new extension type (``stored_auth_key (TBD)``).
It is used in ClientHello and ServerHello messages.  

The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
ClientHello, MUST contain the `StoredInformation` structure.

~~~

  struct {
       select (type) {
         case client:
           opaque hash_value<1..255>;
           opaque ciphertext<1..2^16-1>
         case server:
           AcceptedAuthKey '1';
       } body;
  } StoredInformation
~~~

This document defines the following type:

TODO: SIMPLIFY

- 'pub_key' type for not sending the complete server certificate message:
   With the type field set to 'pub_key', the client MUST include the
   fingerprint of the Public Key of the end-entity certificate in
   the hash_value field. For this type, the fingerprint MUST be calculated
   using the procedure below, using the Public Key (represented
   using the Subject Public Key Info representation, as defined in {{RFC5869}},
   Section 4.1.2.7) as the input data.

The fingerprint calculation proceeds this way:

1.  Compute the SHA-256 hash of the input data. Note that the computed
    hash only covers the input data structure (and not any type and
    length information of the record layer).
2.  Use the output of the SHA-256 hash.

The purpose of the fingerprint provided by the client is to help the
server select the correct information. The fingerprint identifies the server
public key (and the corresponding private key) for use with the rest
of the handshake.

If this extension is not present, the `kem_encapsulation` extension MUST
not be present as well. If present, it will be ignored.

## Protocol messages

The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters
of a connection, as in TLS 1.3. It uses the same messages, expect
for the addition of a `KEMEncapsulation` message and does not use
the `CertificateVerify` one.

~~~
  enum {
      ...
      kem_encapsulation(tbd),
      ...
      (255)
    } HandshakeType;

  struct {
      HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
      uint24 length;             /* remaining bytes in message */
      select (Handshake.msg_type) {
          ...
          case kem_encapsulation:     KEMEncapsulation;
          ...
      };
  } Handshake;
~~~

Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.
A peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST
abort the handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.

## Cryptographic computations

The AuthKEM handshake establishes three input secrets which are
combined to create the actual working keying material, as detailed below. The
key derivation process incorporates both the input secrets and the handshake
transcript.  Note that because the handshake transcript includes the random
values from the Hello messages, any given handshake will have different traffic
secrets, even if the same input secrets are used.

### Key schedule for full AuthKEM handshakes

AuthKEM uses the same HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand functions as defined by
TLS 1.3, in turn defined by {{RFC5869}}.

Keys are derived from two input secrets using the HKDF-Extract and
Derive-Secret functions.  The general pattern for adding a new secret
is to use HKDF-Extract with the Salt being the current secret state
and the Input Keying Material (IKM) being the new secret to be added.

The key schedule proceeds as follows:

~~~
            0
            |
            v
    PSK -> HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder" | "res binder", "")
            |                  = binder_key
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "c e traffic", ClientHello)
            |                  = client_early_traffic_secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "e exp master", ClientHello)
            |                  = early_exporter_master_secret
            v
            Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
            |
            v
(EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "c hs traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...ServerHello)
            |                  = client_handshake_traffic_secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "s hs traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...ServerHello)
            |                  = server_handshake_traffic_secret
            v
            Derive-Secret(., "derived", "") = dHS
            |
            v
    SSs -> HKDF-Extract = Authenticated Handshake Secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "c ahs traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...KEMEncapsulation)
            |                  = client_handshake_authenticated_traffic_secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "s ahs traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...KEMEncapsulation)
            |                  = server_handshake_authenticated_traffic_secret
            v
            Derive-Secret(., "derived", "") = dAHS
            |
            v
SSc||0 * -> HKDF-Extract = Main Secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "c ap traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...server Finished)
            |                  = client_application_traffic_secret_0
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "s ap traffic",
            |                  ClientHello...server Finished)
            |                  = server_application_traffic_secret_0
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "exp master",
            |                  ClientHello...server Finished)
            |                  = exporter_master_secret
            |
            +--> Derive-Secret(., "res master",
                               ClientHello...client Finished)
                               = resumption_master_secret

The * means that if client authentication was requested the `SSc` value should
be used. Otherwise, the `0` value is used.
~~~

### Abbreviated AuthKEM key schedule

The abbreviated AuthKEM handshake follows the {{RFC8446}} key schedule more closely.
We change the computation of the ``EarlySecret`` as follows:
~~~
            0
            |
            v
    SSs -> HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
~~~

We change the computation of ``Main Secret`` as follows:
~~~
            Derive-Secret(., "derived", "") = dHS
            |
            v
SSc||0 * -> HKDF-Extract = Main Secret
~~~

### Compuations of KEM shared secrets


The operations to compute `SSs` or `SSc` from the client are:

~~~
SSs, encapsulation <- Encapsulate(public_key_server,
                                  "server authentication")
               SSc <- Decapsulate(encapsulation, private_key_client,
                                  "client authentication")
~~~

The operations to compute `SSs` or `SSc` from the server are:

~~~
               SSs <- Decapsulate(encapsulation, private_key_server
                                  "server authentication")
SSc, encapsulation <- Encapsulate(public_key_client,
                                  "client authentication")
~~~

### Explicit Authentication Messages

As discussed, AuthKEM generally uses a message for explicit
authentication: Finished message. Note that in the non pre-distributed mode,
AuthKEM achieves explicit authentication only when the server sends the final
``Finished`` message (the client is only implicitly authenticated when they
send their ``Finished`` message). In a pre-distributed mode, the server achieves
explicit authentication when sending their ``Finished`` message (one round-trip
earlier) and the client, in turn, when they send their ``Finished`` message
(one round-trip earlier). Full downgrade resilience and forward secrecy
is achieved once the AuthKEM handshake completes.

The key used to compute the ``Finished`` message is computed from the
``MainSecret`` using HKDF. Specifically:

~~~
server/client_finished_key =
  HKDF-Expand-Label(MainSecret,
                    server/client_label,
                    "", Hash.length)
server_label = "tls13 server finished"
client_label = "tls13 client finished"
~~~


Structure of this message:

~~~
  struct {
      opaque verify_data[Hash.length];
  } Finished;
~~~

The verify_data value is computed as follows:

~~~
server/client_verify_data =
      HMAC(server/client_finished_key,
           Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
                           Certificate*,
                           KEMEncapsulation*,
                           Finished**)

*  Only included if present.
** The party who last sends the finished message in terms of flights
   includes the other party's Finished message.
~~~

See the [abbreviated AuthKEM handshake negotiation section](#sec-authkem-pdk-negotiation) for special considerations for the abbreviated AuthKEM handshake. 

Any records following a Finished message MUST be encrypted under the appropriate application traffic key as described in TLS 1.3.
In particular, this includes any alerts sent by the server in response to client ``Certificate`` and ``KEMEncapsulation`` messages.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

* The academic works proposing KEM-Auth contain a in-depth technical discussion
  of and a proof of the security of the handshake protocol without client
  authentication [KEMTLS]. The work proposing the variant protocol [KEMTLSPDK]
  with pre-distributed public keys has a proof for both unilaterally and
  mutually authenticated handshakes.

* Application Data sent prior to receiving the server's last explicit
  authentication message (the Finished message) can be subject to a client
  downgrade attack, and has weaker forward secrecy compared to TLS 1.3.
  Full downgrade resilience and forward secrecy is achieved once the handshake
  completes.

* The client's certificate is kept secret from active observers by the
  derivation of the `client_authenticated_handshake_secret`, which ensures that
  only the intended server can read the client's identity.

* When the client opportunistically sends its certificate, it is not encrypted
  under a forward-secure key.  This has similar considerations and trade-offs as
  0-RTT data.  If it is a replayed message, there are no expected consequences
  for security as the malicious replayer will not be able to decapsulate the
  shared secret.

* A client that opportunistically sends its certificate, SHOULD send it
  encrypted with a ciphertext that it knows the server will accept. Otherwise,
  it will fail.


## Implicit authentication

Because preserving a 1/1.5RTT handshake in KEM-Auth requires the client to
send its request in the same flight when the `ServerHello` message is received,
it can not yet have explicitly authenticated the server. However,
through the inclusion of the key encapsulated to the server's long-term
secret, only an authentic server should be able to decrypt these messages.

However, the client can not have received confirmation that the server's
choices for symmetric encryption, as specified in the `ServerHello` message,
were authentic. These are not authenticated until the `Finished` message from
the server arrived. This may allow an adversary to downgrade the symmetric
algorithms, but only to what the client is willing to accept. If such an attack
occurs, the handshake will also never successfully complete and no data can be
sent back.

If the client trusts the symmetric algorithms advertised in its `ClientHello`
message, this should not be a concern. A client MUST NOT accept any
cryptographic parameters it does not include in its own `ClientHello` message.

If client authentication is used, explicit authentication is reached before
any application data, on either client or server side, is transmitted.

Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
message, except as specified in Section 2.3 of {{RFC8446}}.  Note that
while the client MAY send Application Data prior to receiving the server's
last explicit Authentication message, any data sent at that point is,
being sent to an implicitly authenticated peer.

       Figure 1: Message Flow for KEM-Authentication (KEM-Auth) Handshake
~~~~~

When using KEMs for authentication, the handshake can be thought of in four
phases compared to the three ones from TLS 1.3. It achieves both confidentiality
and authentication (certificate-based).

After the Key Exchange and Server Parameters phase of TLS 1.3 handshake, the
client and server exchange implicitly authenticated messages.
KEM-based authentication uses the same set of messages every time that
certificate-based authentication is needed.  Specifically:

* Certificate:  The certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate
  extensions.  This message is omitted by the client if the server
  did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that the client
  should not authenticate with a certificate). The Certificate
  MUST include the long-term KEM public key.

* KEMEncapsulation: A key encapsulation against the certificate's long-term
  public key, which yields an implicitly authenticated shared secret.

Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its
Authentication messages, namely Certificate and KEMEncapsulation (if
requested). If client authentication was not requested, the Client
sends its Finished message.

Upon receiving the client's messages, the server responds with its
Finished message, which achieves explicit authentication.
Upon receiving the server's Finished message, the client achieves explicit
authentication.

Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
message, except as specified in Section 2.3 of {{RFC8446}}.  Note that
while the client may send Application Data prior to receiving the server's
last explicit Authentication message, any data sent at that point is, of course,
being sent to an implicitly authenticated peer. It is worth noting
that Application Data sent prior to receiving the server's last
Authentication message can be subject to a client downgrade
attack. Full downgrade resilience is only achieved when explicit
authentication is achieved: when the Client receives the Finished
message from the Server.

## Prior-knowledge KEM-Auth

Given the added number of round-trips of KEM-auth compared to the TLS 1.3,
the handshake can be improved by the usage of pre-distributed
KEM authentication keys to achieve explicit authentication and full downgrade
resilience as early as possible. A peer's long-term KEM authentication key can
be cached in advance, as well.

Figure 2 below shows a pair of handshakes in which the first handshake
establishes cached information and the second handshake uses it:

~~~~~

In some applications, such as in a VPN, the client already knows that the
server will require mutual authentication. This means that a client can proactively
authenticate by sending its certificate as early in the handshake as possible.
The client's certificate has to be sent encrypted by using the shared secret
derived from the kem_encapsulation message.


## Key Exchange Messages

KEM-Auth uses the same key exchange messages as TLS 1.3 with this
exceptions:

- Two extensions can be added to the `ClientHello` message: "stored_auth_key"
  and "kem_encapsulation".
- One extensions can be added to the `ServerHello` message: "stored_auth_key".

KEM-Auth preserves the same cryptographic negotiation with the addition
of the KEM algorithms to the `signature_algorithms`.

### Client Hello

KEM-Auth uses the `ClientHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode, however, two extensions are mandatory: "stored_auth_key"
and "kem_encapsulation" for server authentication. This extensions are
described later in the document.

Note that in KEM-Auth with pre-distributed information, the client's `Certificate`
message gets send alongside the `ClientHello` one for mutual authentication.

### Server Hello

KEM-Auth uses the `ServerHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode, however, one extension is mandatory: "stored_auth_key"
for server authentication. This extension is described later in the document.

When the ServerHello message is received:

- the client and server derive handshake traffic secrets `client_handshake_traffic_secret`
  and `server_handshake_traffic_secret` which are used to encrypt subsequent
  flows in the handshake
- the âhandshake secretâ is derived: `dHS` which is kept as the
  current secret state of the key schedule.

Refer to Section 8.1 for information on how to derive this secrets.

### Hello Retry Request

KEM-Auth uses the `ServerHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode for mutual authentication, a `HelloRetryRequest`
message can be sent, but the client's `Certificate` message is ignored.

### Extensions


### Implicit Authentication Messages

As discussed, KEM-Auth generally uses a common set of messages for implicit
authentication and key confirmation: Certificate and KEMEncapsulation.
The CertificateVerify message MUST NOT be sent.

The computations for the Authentication messages take the following inputs:

-  The certificate and authentication key to be used.
-  A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be included in the
   transcript hash.
-  A Shared Secret Key (from the key exchange operations) to be used to compute an
   authenticated handshake shared key.
-  A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be
   included in the transcript hash.

Based on these inputs, the messages then contain:

Certificate:  The certificate to be used for authentication, and any supporting
  certificates in the chain.

KEMEncapsulation: The KEM encapsulation against the end-entity
  certificate's public key(s).

KEM-Auth follows the TLS 1.3 key schedule, which applies a sequence of HKDF
operations to the Handshake Secret Keys and the handshake context to derive:

- the client and server authenticated handshake traffic secrets
  `client_handshake_authenticated_traffic_secret`
  and `server_handshake_authenticated_traffic_secret` which are used to
  encrypt subsequent flows in the handshake
- updated secret state `dAHS` of the key schedule.
- a Master Key.

### Certificate

KEM-Auth uses the same `Certificate` message as TLS 1.3.

The end-entity `Certificate` or the `RawPublicKey` MUST contain or be a
KEM public key.

Note that we are only specifying here the algorithms in the end-entity
`Certificate`. All certificates provided by the server or client MUST be
signed by an authentication algorithm advertised by the server or client.

### KEM Encapsulation

This message is used to provide implicit proof that an endpoint
possesses the private key(s) corresponding to its certificate by sending
the appropriate parameters that will be used to calculate the implicitly
authenticated shared secret.

The calculation of the shared secret also provides integrity for the handshake
up to this point. Servers MUST send this message when authenticating via a
certificate. Clients MUST send this message whenever authenticating via a
certificate (i.e., when the ``Certificate`` message is non-empty). When sent, this
message MUST appear immediately after the ``Certificate`` message has been
received and prior to the ``Finished`` message.

Structure of this message:

~~~
  struct {
      opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>
      opaque encapsulation<0..2^16-1>;
  } KEMEncapsulation;
~~~

The encapsulation field is the result of a `Encapsulate` function. The
Encapsulation() function will also result in a shared secret (`ssS` or `ssC`,
depending on the peer) which is used to derive the `AHS` or `MS` secrets.

If the `KEMEncapsulation` message is sent by a server, the authentication
algorithm MUST be one offered in the client's `signature_algorithms`
extension unless no valid certificate chain can be produced without
unsupported algorithms.

If sent by a client, the authentication algorithm used in the signature
MUST be one of those present in the `supported_signature_algorithms`
field of the `signature_algorithms` extension in the
`CertificateRequest` message.

In addition, the authentication algorithm MUST be compatible with the key(s)
in the sender's end-entity certificate.

The receiver of a `KEMEncapsulation` message MUST perform the `Decapsulate(enc, skR)`
operation by using the sent encapsulation and the private key of the public key
advertised in the end-entity certificate sent. The `Decapsulate(enc, skR)` function
will also result on a shared secret (`ssS` or `ssC`, depending on the Server or
Client executing it respectively) which is used to derive the `AHS` or `MS` secrets.

`certificate_request_context` is included to allow the recipient to identify the
certificate against which the encapsulation was generated. It MUST be set to the 
value in the `Certificate` message to which the encapsulation was computed. 

### Explicit Authentication Messages

As discussed, KEM-Auth generally uses a message for explicit
authentication: Finished message. Note that in the non pre-distributed mode,
KEM-Auth achieves explicit authentication only when the server sends the final
``Finished`` message (the client is only implicitly authenticated when they
send their ``Finished`` message). In a pre-distributed mode, the server achieves
explicit authentication when sending their ``Finished`` message (one round-trip
earlier) and the client, in turn, when they send their ``Finished`` message
(one round-trip earlier). Full downgrade resilience and forward secrecy
is achieved once the KEM-Auth handshake completes.

The key used to compute the ``Finished`` message is computed from the
``MainSecret`` using HKDF. Specifically:

~~~
server/client_finished_key =
  HKDF-Expand-Label(MainSecret,
                    server/client_label,
                    "", Hash.length)
server_label = "tls13 server finished"
client_label = "tls13 client finished"
~~~


Structure of this message:

~~~
  struct {
      opaque verify_data[Hash.length];
  } Finished;
~~~

The verify_data value is computed as follows:

~~~
server/client_verify_data =
